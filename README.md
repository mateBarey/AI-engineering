ML Folder
The following are a collection of notebooks which include Supervised and Unsupervised 

Ml algos built using Sci-kitlearn for solving different problems including the following:

Cancer Detection,  Predicting Economic Trends, Predicting Customer Churn, Recommendation engines 

The applications for each different problem was used using diffrent ML techiniques such as:

Regression, Classification, Clustering, SVM, Recommender systems, Decision Trees, KNN.


Deep Learning and NN with Keras Folder
In this folder you can find a basic neural network coded from scratch in python. 

A Deep Learning regression network which predicts a label concrete strength using various cement features


Apache Spark Folder
Used Spark ability to run in parallel for running ML models for IOT  weather sensor data. I ran a pipleine with different 

models such as  Regression, Logistic Regression and random forest classifiers for correlating the dependency of weather 

parameters such as wind direction wind speed.


Pytorch Folder
Is a collection of notebooks used to learn Dropout, Momentum, activation functions CNN, Linear and Logistic Regression on Pytorch.
